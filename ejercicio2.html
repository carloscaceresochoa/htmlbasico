                        a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard
                        McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the 
                        more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the 
                        cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum 
                        comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" 
                        (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the
                        theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem 
                        ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

                        The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested.
